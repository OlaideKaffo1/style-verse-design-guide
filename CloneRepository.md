- A terminal or command prompt application
- Node.js and npm installed. See detailed installation instructions below.

## Installing Node.js and npm

### Option 1: Using NVM (Recommended)

NVM (Node Version Manager) is the recommended way to install Node.js as it allows you to easily switch between Node.js versions.

#### For macOS and Linux:

1. Install NVM by running this command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Close and reopen your terminal

3. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js:
   ```sh
   nvm install --lts
   ```

4. Verify installation:
   ```sh
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

#### For Windows:

1. Download and install [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
2. Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window
3. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js:
   ```sh
   nvm install lts
   nvm use lts
   ```

### Option 2: Direct Download

You can also download and install Node.js directly:

1. Visit the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard
4. Verify installation by opening a new terminal and running:
   ```sh
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
